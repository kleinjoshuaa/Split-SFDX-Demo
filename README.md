Salesforce Lightning is Salesforceâ€™s new, modern, and sleek UI. Lightning allows the use of Lightning Web Components (LWC) as a way of allowing developers to make Salesforce Components out of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). 

Split can work in a lightning web component. You can use the SDK in JS in a LWC just like you would use on any other web page. Split's JavaScript SDK meets all the security requirements for the Lightning Locker so you do not have to worry about any security issues. 

Completing this tutorial requires that you have the SFDC CLI, VSCode, and the SFDC Extensions for VSCode all installed.



There are a few steps that are required to make this happen. 

## Add the split sdk as a static resource.

It is important to note that you need to upload the SDK JS file to Salesforce as a Static Resource. Remote JS libraries cannot be loaded in Lightning. 

You can download the minified version from split's CDN as linked on our [JS SDK Help page](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020448791-JavaScript-SDK). Once you have the minified SDK, upload it to Salesforce by clicking the 'new' button and uploading the file. Ensure that cache-control is set to public. 

## Allow the split sdk endpoints as a trusted site.

Add `https://*.split.io` and ensure that the `connect-src` directive is checked

## Link the SFDX code to a Salesforce Org using SFDX and the VSCode extension

##  Deploy by right clicking `default` in the VSCode tree

## Add The Lighting web component to your SF App
1. In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS).
2. Type SFDX.
3. Select SFDX: Open Default Org.
4. This opens your Trailhead Playground in a separate browser.
5. From the App Launcher (App Launcher), find and select Sales.
6. Click Setup gear then select Edit Page.
7. Drag the helloWorld Lightning web component from the Custom area of the Lightning Components list to the top of the Page Canvas.

## See the treatment displayed in Salesforce!

## Code Snippets

The key part of this code is the `helloWorld.js` file that contains the logic to load the Split SDK. 

Additionally, a usage of the `SDK_UPDATE` event allows users to get an updated treatment when Split definitions are updated.

````javascript
import { LightningElement, api } from 'lwc';

// download the split SDK and put it into a static resource called splitsdk
// also ensure that you have added *.split.io to the content security policy
import splitsdk from '@salesforce/resourceUrl/splitsdk';
import { loadStyle, loadScript } from 'lightning/platformResourceLoader';


export default class HelloWorld extends LightningElement {
   treatment = "new"
   treatmentNotLoaded= true;
   renderedCallback() {      
    loadScript(this, splitsdk).then(() => {
        // your code with calls to the JS library
        var factory = splitio({ 
            core: {
              authorizationKey: 'SDK_KEY', // your sdk key
              // key represents your internal user id, or the account id that 
              // the user belongs to. 
              // This could also be a cookie you generate for anonymous users
              key: 'key'
            }
          });
          // And get the client instance you'll use
          var client = factory.client();
          client.on(client.Event.SDK_READY, ()=> {
            console.log('SDK_READY')
            let treatment = client.getTreatment("demo_split");
            console.log('treatment = '+treatment);
            this.treatment=treatment;        
            this.treatmentNotLoaded=false;
          });

          client.on(client.Event.SDK_UPDATE, ()=> {
            console.log('SDK_UPDATE')
            let treatment = client.getTreatment("demo_split");
            console.log('treatment = '+treatment);
            this.treatment=treatment;        
          });
    });
}
}
````
It works with the helloworld.html below

````html
<template>
<template lwc:if={treatmentNotLoaded}>
    <lightning-card  title="HelloWorld" icon-name="custom:custom14" split-managed="true" >
        <div class="slds-m-around_medium" >
            <p></p>
        </div>
   </lightning-card>
  </template>
<template lwc:else>
    <lightning-card title="HelloWorld" icon-name="custom:custom14" split-managed="true" >
        <div class="slds-m-around_medium" >
            <p>Treatment={treatment}</p>
        </div>
   </lightning-card>
  </template>
</template>

````

Here we are using an `lwc:if` directive on the template to display or hide entire templates. You could also do this with information from the treatment. This is a very powerful capability. 


## Using in VisualForce
Similarly to Lightning - the JavaScript library that we set up as a static resource can also be used by VisualForce components. This allows the usage of Split where you may not be able to use Lightning Web Components. 

To do this, first go to the Developer Console when in setup mode

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1207274/226906041-c81bba22-b70b-4f9a-a86e-2b3225527c3c.png)

Then create a new VisualForce Page

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1207274/226906920-43cbd305-de96-473c-8c73-7b2519b417ab.png)

In that page, place the following code, being sure to replace the  `authorizationKey` with your own SDK Key. 

**Note:** that this uses the same `splitsdk` static resource as the Lightning Web Component example above.

````javascript
<apex:page>
    <!-- Add the static resource to page's <head> -->
    <apex:includeScript value="{! $Resource.splitsdk }"/>
    <!-- A short bit of Split SDK Code to test it's there -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
var factory = splitio({ 
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'SDK_KEY',
    // key represents your internal user id, or the account id that 
    // the user belongs to. 
    // This could also be a cookie you generate for anonymous users
    key: 'key'
  }
});
// And get the client instance you'll use
var client = factory.client();
    client.on(client.Event.SDK_READY, function() {
  var treatment = client.getTreatment("aa_test");
              const e = document.getElementById("message");
  if (treatment == "on") {
      // insert code here to show on treatment
	e.innerText="It is On!"
  } else if (treatment == "off") {
      // insert code here to show off treatment
      	e.innerText="It is Off!"
  } else {
      // insert your control treatment code here
      e.innerText="Houston, we have a problem"
  }
});
    </script>
    <!-- Where the  message will appear -->
    <h1 id="message"></h1>
</apex:page>
````

Then, clicking Preview at the top left of the Developer Console will show the final result of the Split treatment.
